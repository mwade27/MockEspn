# MockEspn
Semi Mock Espn website 
# Tech Stack 
python, sci-kit, unless i can learn pytorch,MySQL
# Plan
Create FullStack appliction that uses Flask and React to
build a mock Espn. 
A user should be able to create an account and sign in 
choose what teams to follow/favorite
The application will have the following sports initially
Football, Basketball stretch goal Baseball, super stretch goal Hockey
A machine learning model should be created for real-time prediction
of a sports outcome atleast for basketball and football 
Another machine learning model for predicting outcomes of games before they start 
Set up text notifications to be sent to your phone to notify games start time
Database for storing historical games and data 
Maybe do some web scraping for team news(could start with one sport) 
If we do this we can create an AI to summerize and provide the important parts 
of the news on the site.
